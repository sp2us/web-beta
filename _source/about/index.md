we are here for the productivity of anyone,<br/>for any work, at anytime.
===

You are students having trouble finding place to do school project together?  
You are entrepreneurs filled with ideas but can’t find anywhere to discuss?  
You are freelancers without a true and professional workspace?  
You are a NGO/Non-profit organization and meeting online doesn’t work?  
You are just someone who need a place to focus, to be inspired and to experience the feeling of a professional yet cozy workspace?

This is for us, and you. This is for everyone. A space for more than just chatting. A space for more than just sitting and have a nice view and enjoy a good cup of coffee. This is for the ideas to grow, for the discussion, the brainstorming process and meetings to work out effectively. Space++ is for the productivity of anyone for any work at any time.

The key point here is you are not only come and leave, you have a place for you to leave your branding mark, both online and offline (on a board). This will be the opportunity for you to hunt for a job, or to find your co-founder in your startup, or maybe... a friend. This is the network focus on real people, real information and real chances to reach people, since all of the data will be collected from the real customers and companies which have come to Space++.
