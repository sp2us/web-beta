What are agile tools?

In a broad sense, Agile tools are a series of processes that help software developers manage projects by utilizing methods that are based on iterative and incremental development. The belief is that by rapidly repeating cycles over short or incremental periods of time, developers can take advantage of what they have learned during the design process and immediately introduce new ideas into the next iteration of the design.

It’s like a boot camp for the learn-by-doing approach which can take projects to a whole new level. Conceptualize, design, learn, feedback, conceptualize, design, learn, etc. A key habit for success when using Agile tools is to rapidly crank the circular gear of learning, creation and feedback until you have developed a fully realized product.

The concepts of Agile methodology had been floating around as early as 1957, however they were finally organized an given a name in 2001, with the publishing of The Agile Manifesto. The was a direct response to the frustrations of working within the traditional Waterfall method of sequential development.

The waterfall method, which originated with the rise of the manufacturing and construction industries, is a simple top-down system of planning, concept, building, testing and delivery. It works well for delivering large expensive physical products, where changes would be cost prohibitive, but it lacks the ability to change or adapt to new insights along the way.

In some industries the waterfall method can be useful. Imagine building a house, where the architect and the client would continually change their minds or innovate new modes of construction. Moving doors and changing floorplans at a moments notice. The foundation dug up and moved, the wood frame dismantled and rebuilt, the pulling of the electrical and the relocation of plumbing lines. It wouldn’t happen. It couldn’t happen. But in other industries such as software development and digital arts, creators have the necessity (and luxury) of using different methods.

Agile methods succeed for software developers especially, because they allow the many phases of development to happen at once. The building, testing and analyzing happen together, and they happen often. This allows constant tweaking and innovation, and creates a kind of modular product that can be configured differently depending on the the needs of the client, without additional time or cost.

These methods allow developers, designers, clients and end users, to discover interesting insights as they are being created. It is a collaborative project in which everyone pushes and pulls at a mound of clay, intuitively working together to create something that benefits the whole group. In an ideal situation, the result is greater than the sum of it’s parts. In short, it makes creative teams more productive and more flexible in a shorter amount of time. It boosts productivity and simplifies time management. But it’s not just groups who can benefit from the ideas within Agile methodology.

It is a truism generally acknowledged in the field of development that the end user doesn’t really know what they want until they see it. The same can be said of graphic design, writing, painting or music. The consumer often doesn’t know what they want until is is presented to them, thoughtfully packaged or shining brightly on a white gallery wall. Even those doing the creating can even experience this sense of not-knowing. Often the developer, designer, or artist doesn’t have a clear picture of what they want. This is why rapid prototyping, which could be considered a part of agile methodology, has been such a robust topic in recent years.

Once a product can be seen and touched it can further inform the creator of what is missing and what it needs to be. The process of working quickly with a specific sets a parameters frees the designer to focus on specific aspects creation. It allows them to address problems as they arrive and to change the material as needed. After enough quick and purposeful iterations, a finished product will appear. It is the process itself that creates the new way of approaching the design problems and it is the process itself that induces the new and better work.

Intuitively, it makes sense that the shifting patterns of commerce (on demand printing, one-touch buying and shipping of products, instant downloads of media) and human interaction (tweets, insta-moments, compact rapid sharing) have emerged along side this now prevalent style of development. Humans today can choose to change and tweak entire online profiles with a few clicks and customize entire portions of their lives from clothing to media to online presence. Reflexively, the creators of new software, design or physical objects must be able to adapt quickly, in short bursts, with improvements or updates to each iteration.

Creating a fully realized work in any timespan, whether it be software or a physical object, that addresses a need and functions properly, can seem like magic, but it is really just process. The secret sauce in Agile methodology is the strict adherence to a process. It is the process that provides improved quality, productivity, and the ability to leverage new insights into powerful features or qualities.

Two great thoughts on the power of process come from Charles Eames and Chuck Close. Eames, who was well know throughout his career to revere theprocessof creating, famously asserted that, “Art resides in the quality of doing. Process is not magic.” 

He felt that real insights come out of the process itself, and it shows in the enduring quality of his work. Close, who is know for his process intensive large works, also echoed this sentiment. “All the best ideas come out of the process; they come out of the work itself. Things occur to you. If you're sitting around trying to dream up a great art idea, you can sit there a long time before anything happens. But if you just get to work, something will occur to you and something else will occur to you and something else that you reject will push you in another direction,” he said. These are valuable words for all those whose work requires an adherence to a set plan of action.

A lengthy scan of the digital magazine rack that is the internet, reveals an interesting pattern. Nearly all the suggestions for increasing personal productivity, whether casual or professional, include the idea of standardizing the process of your work. Planning and establishing a routine are essential to a consistent and efficient output.

Two of the most popular methods of productivity for freelancers are the Pomodoro Technique and Don’t Break the Chain. Developed by Francesco Cirillo in the 1980s, the Pomodoro Technique boxes work into 25 minute intervals to create an intense period of focus and flow, rewarding the users with a break after each cycle.

Don’t Break the Chain is another simple idea of leveraging the power of process. Users mark their calendar everyday that they work on a project, the idea being that if they get enough days in a row, then they won’t want to break the chain. The strength of this productivity tool is in the process of physically working on something everyday. If you work on a certain task repeatedly it will eventually begin to feedback into itself.

Both strategies relate to Agile methods in some very basic ways. Because the Pomodoro Technique requires setting timers throughout the day, it encourages focus for incremental periods of time. By planning, tracking and recording their output, freelancers can more clearly gauge their progress, estimate costs and gather insights. Also, by taking breaks early and often, they can gain input from unrelated stimuli, which often spark some idea that will help with the current larger task.

Users of the Don’t Break the Chain style of productivity, develop a routine which helps to focus a daily cycle around one main idea. The process itself then creates more work and in turn, more insights. For freelancers working alone, consider these tools like your personal development team. Daily interaction with them ensures that projects stay on task, feedback is generated, and improvements are made.

If you work in software development, you are probably already using Agile methods on a daily basis, but if you tend to work on projects alone, perhaps some of it’s concepts can improve your productivity. Agile methods and productivity are interrelated and complimentary. In both scenarios, it’s all about the process.

For those looking to succeed in the modern world of rapidly changing wants, needs and trends, it will be advantageous to make yourself familiar with a few of these methods and strategies. They will help guide your creative process and enable you to get more done, more efficiently and with a greater sense of accomplishment at each interval.  Don’t be afraid to borrow from any and all successful methods you see around you, but be sure to respect the process.
